->> The codes in Python are used to extract, manipulate and interpret the data contained in the several packets and experiments performed.

->> The codes uses as input the log files of the transmitters that follows the format : 

communicationPort_experimentOptions_timeExperiment.log

and the coordinator as : 

C0_experimentOptions_timeExperiment.log

->>The communication port is associated with the device identifier (E1,E2,I1,I2).

->>Each code is used for different number of transmitters. Also, we upload the code used to perfom experiments withouth the XCTU software and only python as terminal.
